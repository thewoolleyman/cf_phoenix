  # NOTE: Running the migration here assumes instances will always be set to 1!
  #       Before scaling up instances to >1, there needs to be a custom mix task
  #       which only runs on first instance.  E.g. `mix cf.ecto.migrate.on_first_instance`
  #       See https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/migrate-db.html
  command: mix ecto.migrate && mix phoenix.server
